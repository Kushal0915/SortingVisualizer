Sorting Visualizer Project: 
- I made this project when I was in DSA and I watned to learn some basic sorting algorithms through a visual medium. There are other projects like this out there, but I wanted to be able to do it myself plus it also helped in learning Java Swing and Awt cause there was a lot of self teaching for that.
- In the future I could a couple features such as being able to stop the algorithm mid way, resetting mid-way, letting users decide how fast or slow they want to see the visualization, and adding other algorithms such as heap sort, Radix sort, etc...

How to Run: 
- download the zip file
- run SortingVisualizer in any IDE (I used Eclipse)

How to Use the Program: 
- There aren't many options users are limited to:
- setting array size (10 <= x <= 50)
- Resetting the array
- Sorting the array
- Choosing the algorithm

What I Learned: 
- Sorting algorithms for selection, insertion, bubble, merge, and quick sort
- run time complexities of each algorithm
- Desining a GUi using java swing and awt
